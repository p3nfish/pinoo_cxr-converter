Chaos Czech a.s., 2014-2025
www.corona-renderer.com

Usage:
    CoronaImageCmd [arguments] <input image> [other input images] <output image>
        Process all given input images according to arguments and write result to output image.

    CoronaImageCmd --list-examples
        Print examples of usage.

    CoronaImageCmd --list-properties
        Print all recognized configuration properties.

Options:
        --list-properties    Prints descriptions of all properties recognized by the --set and
                             --config arguments. See the information for those arguments for further
                             details.

        --list-examples      Prints some example usage.

        --batch              Processes images independently. Every provided image must be followed
                             by the output file. With this argument, <weight> argument can't be
                             used, as that is used for multiple input files being processed together
                             to generate one output file.

    -w, --weight=<value>     Sets a weight, or weights, to use while merging/stitching multiple
                             images into one.
                             If more than one input image is given, the editor will compose each
                             pixel as a weighted arithmetic mean of corresponding pixels retrieved
                             from the input images. Using this argument you can define a single
                             weight for all input images, or define a different weight for each
                             individual image (specify the argument multiple times).
                             Each weight could be either -
                             A float constant for a whole image (use the dot as a decimal
                             separator):
                             --weight "<float constant> [--weight <float constant>...]"
                             Or the name of a special channel containing float weight values for
                             each pixel (prefix the name with the percent sign):
                             --weight "%<channel name> [--weight %<channel name>...]"
                             If no --weight argument is given, all input images will be
                             merged/stitched using a weight channel named CORONA_FB_WEIGHTS that is
                             present in all renders made by Chaos Corona.

    -e, --element=<value>    Default value: *
                             Selects a render element that should be processed and saved.
                             It could be either -
                             The name of a single render element as it is presented in the GUI
                             version of the editor, for instance the beauty render element:
                             --element "BEAUTY"
                             Or the asterisk symbol for selecting all render elements at once:
                             --element "*"
                             If no --element argument is given, the second variant is the default.

    -s, --set=<value>        Overrides the value of some selected property.
                             All image operations that the editor can perform are controlled by
                             properties. The value of each property arises independently from the
                             following precedence list (the latter ones automatically override the
                             previous ones):
                             (1) global default value defined by Chaos Corona
                             (2) default value loaded from the input image, if it is in Corona EXR
                             format and the value is present there
                             (3) value set by the right-most --set or --config argument on the
                             command-line
                             The argument expects a formatted string in the following form:
                             --set "<property type> <property name> = <property value>"
                             All bool values are expected to be either "true" or "false". Float
                             values must use dots as decimal separators. Colors are expected as
                             float triplets separated by spaces. Integer values can sometimes be
                             replaced by predefined string constants. Use the --list-properties
                             argument for further details.

    -c, --config=<path>      Loads a configuration file to override the values of some properties.
                             It expects a path to some configuration file previously exported from
                             the GUI version of the editor, or from Chaos Corona's VFB:
                             --config "C:\Path\To\File.conf"
                             In all other aspects, it behaves in the same way as the --set argument.

    -h, --help               Show this help message.

        --version            Show version & application information.
